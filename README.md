## Getting Started
Hello team! Your tremendous leader is talking!
So I have set up 3 key folders one for the project/programming, one for the end report, one for the Documentation of the code.I would really like to see these all updated as we go rather than rushing them one at a time. try to keep track of what you are doing so everyone else can follow along when we collaborate and integrate.

Good Luck!
